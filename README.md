DnD character statistics

Introduction
------------

Almost a year ago FiveThirtyEight published a short article called [Is Your D&D Character Rare?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-your-dd-character-rare/). It was a product of a deal between Curse and FiveThirtyEight which meant the data was not available to anyone else which, I thought at the time, was a shame. Shortly after that I released a few add ons ([1](https://oganm.github.io/printSheetApp/),[2](https://oganm.github.io/5eInteractiveSheet/)) for a popular mobile application, [Fifth Edition Character Sheet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wgkammerer.testgui.basiccharactersheet.app&hl=en_CA) which allowed me to collect the users' character sheets.

After 3.5 months of data collection I have a whopping... 613 unique characters in my database that I can play with. Well... I'm not as popular as DnDBeyond but I don't see anyone else waving around thousands of character sheets for us to data mine so it'll have to do.

Is Your D&D Character Rare? II
------------------------------

To start with let's repeat the original analysis from FiveThirtyEight. I am not going to pretend like I have many thousands of samples so instead of per 100,000 this shows class and race combinations per 100 characters. You'll also notice that there are decimal points. In FiveThirtyEight's table, characters with multiple classes count once for each class. Here I divided multiclassed characters based on the proportion of their class levels. For instance a character who is a Fighter 5/Rogue 15 will add 0.75 to the rogue count and 0.25 to the fighter count. It also includes all races.

Despite the methodoligal differences, these results seem to match with FiveThirtyEight data. Graph below shows the % occurence of a class/race combination in FiveThityEight data and my data.

Is your multiclass combination rare?
------------------------------------

Since our dataset includes multiclassed characters, we can see which classed tend to appear together. Note that our sample size much smaller here (73 characters).

About the data
--------------

Unique characters are aquired by grouping the characters that share the same name and class and picking the higher level version. If a multiclassed character shares name with a single classed character, I assume they are duplicates if the single classed character is lower level and its class matches with one of the classes of the multiclassed character.

As all data, this data comes with caveats. It is a subset of all DnD players who are using a particular mobile application who also know about and use my applications and consented to let me to keep their character sheets. I don't have reason to think that these would be enriching certain character building choices but it's something to keep in mind.

I do believe however it is likely to have less test characters than DnDBeyond because my tools require a pre-existing character created in a different tool. Even if a user wants to just test it out they are likely to have a pre-existing character. This is of course my humble opinion (in fact 2 characters in my corpus are named "Test").
